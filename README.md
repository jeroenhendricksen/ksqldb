# ksqlDB

This repository uses docker and compose to setup an environment for experimenting with ksqlDB.
It's based on [this quickstart guide](https://ksqldb.io/quickstart.html) and then adapted it to support [this](https://www.confluent.io/blog/how-real-time-stream-processing-safely-scales-with-ksqldb/) interesting blog on scaling.
